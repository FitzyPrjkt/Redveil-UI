"""BOLA / IDOR check — Broken Object Level Authorization detector.

ACTIVE check. Tests whether authenticated users can read resources they do
NOT own by changing the object ID in the URL (the textbook "IDOR" attack).
The check requires the operator to provision at least TWO test accounts in
``AuthConfig.principals`` and to enumerate IDOR-style endpoints by hand.

CRITICAL SAFETY RULES — read carefully:

    1. **Read-only**. The check only ever issues GET requests. Never POST,
       PUT, PATCH, or DELETE — modifying state across accounts is not the
       job of an authorization checker (that is BFLA territory).
    2. **No enumeration**. We test at most three well-known IDs (1, 2, 3)
       per endpoint pattern. We do NOT iterate through long ID ranges.
    3. **No brute force**. We use exactly the operator-supplied credentials
       from ``AuthConfig.principals``. No guessing, no rotation.
    4. **No exfiltration**. The check records body SHAPES (status, length,
       a short excerpt) for evidence. It does not transmit, store, or
       transcribe full resource contents beyond what is needed to confirm
       cross-account access.

Mechanism:
    Each ``PrincipalConfig`` in ``AuthConfig.principals`` is rendered as a
    per-request auth override (cookies / Authorization header) and applied
    to a fresh ``Request`` via the new ``auth_override_headers`` /
    ``auth_override_cookies`` fields. The HttpClient applies these on top
    of the configured ``AuthProvider``, effectively re-authenticating as
    the named principal for that single request. The principal's name is
    captured in the resulting Evidence so reports show "Account B accessed
    resource owned by Account A".

    For each candidate endpoint + ID, we:
        1. Issue the request as Principal A (the "owner" — first principal).
        2. If A gets 200, the resource exists and A can read it.
        3. Issue the same request as Principal B (and any further principals).
        4. If B also gets 200 and the body either matches A's or differs in
           a way that does NOT obviously indicate A's data being protected,
           we have a BOLA finding.

A note on signal quality: this check deliberately errs on the side of
fewer findings. The default "owner" heuristic is naive — the first
principal in the list is treated as the resource owner — because in
practice the operator has provisioned two accounts specifically to test
each other's access. A more sophisticated version would parse the body
for an owner_id field, but that requires per-application knowledge we
don't have.
