"""Async token-bucket rate limiter used by the HTTP transport.

The HttpClient wraps every outbound request in a TokenBucket.acquire() so
that all plugins share a single, predictable rate budget. Concurrent

    The bucket holds at most `capacity` tokens and refills at `rate` tokens

    not need to manage their own throttling.

    Multiple concurrent acquirers share the bucket via an internal lock.
    The lock is held only for the bookkeeping portion of acquire(); the
    actual blocking wait happens outside the lock to avoid head-of-line
    blocking.

        rate: Tokens added per second. Must be > 0.
        capacity: Maximum tokens the bucket can hold. Defaults to
            `max(1, int(rate))` — i.e., allow one burst up to one second's
            worth of traffic.
