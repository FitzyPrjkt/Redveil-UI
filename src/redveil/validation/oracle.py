"""Oracle — defines what counts as evidence for a finding.

Different checks use different evidence. A status-code-only diff is a
weak oracle (could be a redirect, rate-limit, or unrelated change). A
state transition is a strong oracle (session was actually invalidated).
An ownership violation is a very strong oracle (we have direct proof
the boundary is broken).

Each check declares which Oracle class it uses. The Oracle informs
the ConfidenceScorer how to weight the signals it collected.
